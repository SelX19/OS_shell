## An outline of what you did for the assignment;  


## Instructions for compiling your programs/scripts;  

### Step 1:  
git clone https://github.com/SelX19/OS_shell.git  
### Step 2:  
Check if the C code is compiled, if not you need to compile it. We reccomend using this command:  
gcc -Wall -o "filenameYouWant" "custom_shell_1.c"  

If you are on windows you will need to install the gcc/mingw and compile the code into an .exe:  
gcc -Wall -o "filenameYouWant.exe" "custom_shell_1.c"   

## Any challenges you encountered along the way;  
Everything.

## Any sources/tutorials you have used to complete the assignment;  
ChatGPT, StackOverflow, YouTube  
  

If your implementation does not work, you should document the problems, preferably with your explanation of why it does not work and how you would solve it if you had more time;  


Of course, you should comment on your code.
